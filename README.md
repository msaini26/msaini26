# Hey there, I'm Mansi 👋! 

I’m an undergraduate in California studying computer science with a specialization in game design. I am passionate about increasing diversity in the technology field through my involvement with TechTogether as a hacker and mentor and Major League Hacking (MLH) as a hackathon coach. I am an avid hacker 👩‍💻 who has won seven hackathons and is an MLH Top 50 hacker. With my interest in human-computer interaction and development, I plan to pursue a career related to UI/UX Development and Software Engineering in the future. In my free time, I am a national park enthusiast 🌲 and enjoy learning languages. 📫 Please feel free to reach out if you would like to chat. Enjoy! ✨
