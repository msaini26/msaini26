# Hey there, I'm Mansi 👋! 

I’m an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Cruz studying computer science with a specialization in game design. I am passionate about increasing diversity in the technology field through my involvement with TechTogether as a hacker and mentor, Major League Hacking as a hackathon coach, Hydrangea Hacks as an organizer, and the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) as a campus representative. I am an avid hacker 👩‍💻 who has won seven hackathons and was a 2021 NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Regional Affiliate Winner. With my interest in human-computer interaction and development, I plan to work as a Software Engineer or UX & Cybersecurity Engineer in the future. In my free time, I am a national park enthusiast 🌲 and enjoy learning languages. 📫 Please feel free to reach out if you would like to chat. Enjoy! ✨
